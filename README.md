# StartupTrends
Project idea is to procedurally generate graphs on startup technology stacks with a webapp. Still in progress.

Scraping of http://yclist.com/ done using BeautifulSoup. Next step is to update the database with the technology stacks for each company.

The scraping of the startup data on stackshare.io resulted in a ip ban, so this project was unfortunately abandoned.
